<h1>Real Estate Listings Canada</h1>

<p>
Throughout 2023, the real estate market in Ontario underwent a substantial surge in prices. As housing prices gradually stabilize, I found it interesting to analyze and visualize current housing trends.
</br>
This web application allows you to explore statistics on listings by locality in Ontario and visualize these listings through an interactive map and a table view. The data is refreshed every >6 hours to ensure accuracy and relevance of current listings.
</br>
Below, you will find the ETL architecture of the data pipeline, a demo of the application, and a link to the project.
